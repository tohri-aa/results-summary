## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I think a really important aspect was learning how to stick to working with mobile first. I had a hard time especially when i had to use media queries. I'm really hopeful about getting things pretty straight.

### Continued development
I'm still not completely comfortable with working with css grids and flexbox. Looking forward to practising with lots of project to refine my skillset in these areas.

### Useful resources

- The scrimba course on css grids by Per Harald Borgen really came in handy when I got stuck on flexbox. 
- W3schools serves as an amazing site that helped me understand grids better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
